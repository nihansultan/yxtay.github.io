Hi, my name is YuXuan Tay. 
I am a data scientist from Singapore.

I build end-to-end machine learning systems to make business impact.
This includes developing data transformation pipelines, model development, 
model training scheduling, model serving, deployment and monitoring.

My experience in the data science field started in 2014 
and has spanned across industries 
such as insurance, government, ecommerce and travel.
This has given me professional experience on data science domains 
such as topic modelling, text classification, 
dynamic personalised recommendation and ranking.
I have also developed models for text generation 
and embedding learning with matrix factorisation.
I am familiar with deep learning techniques in domains
such as natural language processing, computer vision 
and product recommendation.

I graduated from National University of Singapore with a degree in
Bachelor of Science, 1st Class Honours in Statistics.
I was the valedictorian for the Statistics Class of 2014.

Outside of work, I enjoy exercising calisthenics workouts, 
mountain hiking, travelling and following Formula 1.
