Hi, my name is YuXuan Tay. 
I am a data scientist from Singapore.

I build end-to-end machine learning systems to make business impact.
This includes developing data transformation pipelines, model development, 
model training scheduling, model serving, deployment and monitoring.

I have been working in the data science field since 2015.
My experience spans across various industries 
such as insurance, government, ecommerce and travel.
This has given me professional experience on different data science domains 
such as topic modelling, text classification and dynamic personalised recommendation.
I have also developed models for text generation 
and embedding learning with matrix factorisation.
I am familiar with deep learning techniques in domains
such as natural language processing, computer vision and product recommendation.

I graduated from National University of Singapore with a degree in
Bachelor of Science, 1st Class Honours in Statistics.
I was the valedictorian for the Statistics Class of 2014.

Outside of work, you may find me exercising calisthenics workouts, hiking on a mountain or nature trail.
